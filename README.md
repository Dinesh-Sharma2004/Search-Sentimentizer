# Search-Sentimentizer
A Python-based web application that combines web scraping and sentiment analysis to fetch search results from Google and analyze their sentiment. This project uses SerpAPI to retrieve search results and TextBlob for sentiment analysis, all integrated into a Flask web application.

#Features
Search and Scrape: Fetches search results for any topic from Google using SerpAPI.

Sentiment Analysis: Analyzes the sentiment of the search result snippets, categorizing them as positive, neutral, or negative.

Intuitive Web Interface: Simple and user-friendly interface for entering topics and viewing sentiment results.

Custom Ranking: Displays results ranked by sentiment polarity.


#Technologies Used

Python: Core programming language.
Flask: Web framework for creating the application.
SerpAPI: API for fetching Google search results.
TextBlob: Library for performing sentiment analysis.
HTML/CSS: For the frontend.
